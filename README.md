# Blackjack Switch!

## What is it!
Blackjack Switch is a lot like blackjack, except you're dealt two hands at a time and can switch the top cards .

## How do I get started!
 Visit the link attached at the top of the page and either log in or create an account.  
 Make a bet and hit deal. From there a glowing outline will let you know which card set you're playing.  
 You can hit (add a card), stay(pass your turn), or switch(swap the top cards of each hand). 
 The game ends like a traditional blackjack game, when you either get 21, you bust, or the dealer busts.  

## What's it use?
 We have a solid mix of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I interact with the backend using the fetch api.

## Backend you say?
 I do say! I'm accessing a backend also made by me, it needs some work, but it gets the job done.
